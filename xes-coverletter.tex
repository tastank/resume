\par To whom it may concern,

\par I first heard of Extreme Engineering Solutions at this year's Computer Science Job Fair.~
    I was intrigued by the name of the company and poster images of what looked like rather robust hardware accompanying a booth that looked rather unvisited.~
    I spoke briefly with an enthusiastic employee who assured me that X-ES would have an opening that for which I would not only be qualified, but interested.~

\par I am excited for the chance to work at a small company such as X-ES, and one in its field.~
    Naturally, the fact that X-ES products are used in demanding aerospace applications appeals to me.~
    Additionally, I not only meet or exceed all of the qualifications for this position, but my most recently obtained experience has given me practice in almost all of the fields required for this position.~
    In my position at Pilot Training System I am developing a solution comprised of C\# and C++ applications to drive the weather engine in Microsoft FSX and its descendant simulators.~
    This project uses Microsoft's SimConnect SDK, which is employed in a largely event-based manner.~
    As I was not the first developer on the project, much of my work has been in debugging and restructuring existing code.~
    In addition, the project requires a web interface, designed and run on a RedHat Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP server, on the same website for which I developed the quizzing software for UW-Madison's new Introduction to Private Pilot course.~
    Finally, while I expect to receive my Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science in May of 2016, I will have completed the degree requirements by the end of this year.~
    I am choosing not to graduate so that I may compete with the Wiscosin Flying Team at this year's national SAFECON competition, which is the last for which I can possibly be eligible to compete.

\par I look forward to discussing the opportunities I may have at Extreme Engineering Solutions.~
    I will call you next week to answer any other questions you may have, and would love to schedule a visit to talk to you in person around that time if possible -- you can use my contact information at the bottom of this page if you wish to reach me sooner regarding the same.~

\par Sincerely,\\
Tyler A Stank\\
