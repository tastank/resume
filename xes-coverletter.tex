\par To whom it may concern,

\par I first heard of Extreme Engineering Solutions at this year's Computer Science Job Fair.~
    I was intrigued by the name of the company and poster images of what looked like rather robust hardware accompanying a booth that looked rather unvisited.~
    I spoke briefly with an enthusiastic employee who assured me that X-ES would have an opening that for which I would not only be qualified, but interested.~

\par I am happily surprised to see that opportunities exist in the Madison area to work with embedded systems.~
    As a student, this is not something I have had many chances to do, though I have a fair amount of experience working with Arduino as a hobby.~
    In addition, my previous experience meets or exceeds all of the requirements for the Application Development Co-op for which I am applying.~
    My current position with Pilot Training System requires development of several web applications in addition to the ClimaDrive flight simulator weather engine;
    I am currently implementing an online payment platform to allow sales of the ClimaDrive software and other services provided by PTS to commence.~
    Earlier, I implemented a quiz-generating application on the same website which is used in UW College of Engineering courses.~
    All of this work is done on a RedHat Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP server, and aside from the server-side weather software I have implemented all which I mentioned here myself.~
    In addition to working with that server, I have considerable experience in Linux server administration from working with the Internet Scout project two years ago.~
    Further, I am currently enrolled in an introductory computer graphics course.~
    In a break with the course's tradition, it is taught using JavaScript and various graphical applications, such as WebGL, which use it.~

\par I look forward to discussing the opportunities I may have at Extreme Engineering Solutions.~
    I will call you next week to answer any other questions you may have, and would love to schedule a visit to talk to you in person around that time if possible -- you can use my contact information at the bottom of this page if you wish to reach me sooner regarding the same.~

\par Sincerely,\\
